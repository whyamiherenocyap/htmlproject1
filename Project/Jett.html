Jett is of South Korean descent. She was the 10th Agent to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL, and is among the youngest of its members[1][2].

Jett is often regarded as having a 'toxic' attitude towards people. She prefers to do things her own way, without relying on a team, and is greatly confident in her own abilities. Jett's immense self-confidence can come across as arrogance, and feel as if she is disregarding her comrade's safety, however her voice lines indicate that she is opening up to those around her. They suggest that she does care for her friends, but doesn't know how to show it.

Jett's Radiant powers allow her to control the wind, using it to propel herself, other objects, and levitate to a degree. While she usually uses her powers in a straightforward manner (such as summoning a gust to propel herself upwards with her Updraft), we see from her select animation (in which she levitates one of her daggers in the air and twirls it around) that she can exercise much finer control over the wind when needed.

It is also implied, from her Mirrored Edge Playercard and Fade's dossier about her (see below) that she once summoned a massive storm over the city of Seoul. This hints that her abilities can be lot more powerful and destructive than we've seen as well.

Before she joined the Protocol, Jett used to be a chef, working at a restaurant in Seoul. However, at some point, that restaurant got destroyed due to a severe wind storm (the same one mentioned above), assumed to be caused by Jett herself.
