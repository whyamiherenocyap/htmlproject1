<h1>Briefing</h1>
<p>
Top squads of their region, LOUD and OpTic Gaming formed a rivalry that grew more heated throughout the year. They have already faced one another five times in 2022.

During the group stage, OpTic struck first with a 2-1 victory in Group B’s winners’ match. LOUD evened it up with a convincing 2-0 win in the upper bracket final. Both teams then settled their score in the final VCT match of the year.

LOUD emerged victorious and were crowned the Valorant world champions after they defeated OpTic Gaming 3-1. The Brazilian squad played great under pressure, winning two maps that went into overtime.

With their first-place finish at Valorant Champions 2022, LOUD took home US$300,000. They also took home the coveted Champions trophy, which they will be defending on their home turf when the VCT 2023 season kicks off at next year’s first international event in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>

<br>
<p>LOUD then never looked back, winning six straight rounds en route to their first global Valorant tournament ever.

With the conclusion of the VCT 2022 season, all organizations, teams, and players will now transition into the new partnership program starting next year where franchise-approved teams will compete in three international leagues.</p></div>
