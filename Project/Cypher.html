Cypher, also known by his real name, Amir, is a Moroccan tech user with a dark and mysterious past. He has no ties to anyone and seems to have lost his family in the past. Cypher has a quirky sense of humor but is always watching the enemy.
Although he is a dangerous and dark person, Cypher makes jokes and lightens up the atmosphere in the team. Many of his voice lines involve playing around with the rest of the VALORANT PROTOCOL, however Cypher can also be much more morbid, referring to the enemy team in a dark manner. Cypher also makes references to gambling, implying that he may have a history related to casinos. Cypher's most sensitive aspect is when it comes to his wife named Nora, and his child. He mentions also his family as a whole, and implies that he has somehow lost all or most of his family.

Cypher uses information from his camera and Trapwires to take over the arena. Cypher uses his self-made Spycam to tag enemies and reveal their locations, along with Cyber Cages to influence enemy movement. He uses tripwires to catch foes off guard, revealing their location and concussing them. Cypher also has a hat which is more than it seems. When thrown at a corpse, it turns into a spider-like robot which reveals the locations of all living enemies around the map. Cypher made his whole kit from the tripwires to his special hat.

Cypher does not have proper relations with anyone, but he has a negative view towards Kingdom, as he thinks they take away the culture from places and tell lies about their practices. This may be because of their unethical and immoral practices, but Kingdom may have played a larger role in his past, possibly to do with his family.
