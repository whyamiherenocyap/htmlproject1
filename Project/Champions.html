<h1>Valorant Champions</h1>
<p style="color:white;">
The Valorant Champions Tour (VCT) is a global competitive esports tournament series for the video game Valorant organised by Riot Games, the game's developers. The series runs multiple events throughout each season, culminating in Valorant Champions, the top-level event of the tour. The VCT was announced in 2020, with its inaugural season taking place in 2021.

<h1>History</h1>
Inaugural season
In November 2020, Riot Games announced the first Valorant Champions Tour, a tournament series divided into three tiers: Challengers, Masters, and Champions. Challengers would act as the lowest tier, split into six regions. Teams that advance past Challengers would move on to Masters, where teams would not be divided by regions anymore, and the top 16 teams from Masters would move on to Champions, the final tournament of VCT.In February 2021, they announced the VCT Game Changers, a supplementary tournament initiative for women and marginalized genders.

Riot hired esports infrastructure company Nerd Street Gamers to be the operators and producers for all North American Challengers and Masters events.They also hired several third-party companies to broadcast their events, such as Liga de Videojuegos Profesional (LVP) for their Spanish-language broadcasts and LetsPlay.Live for their Oceania broadcasts.[5] The 2021 Champions tournament took place on December 1–12 at the Verti Music Hall in Berlin, Germany, concluding with team Acend defeating Gambit Esports in the grand finals by a score of 3–2.

Over 10,000 teams competed in the VCT in 2021. Outside of Champions, VCT saw its highest viewership at the Reykjavik Masters tournament in May, with a peak viewership of 1,085,850. The Champions grand finals match in December reached a peak viewership of 1,089,068, making it the VCT's highest peak viewership.

2022 season
Riot made several changes to the format of VCT for its second iteration. While the overall structure of Challengers, Masters, and Champions remained unchanged, it reduced the number of stages of Challengers and Masters events from three to two. VCT Challengers began on February 11, 2022.The 2022 Champions tournament will take place from September 1 to 18 in Istanbul, Turkey.

<h1>Format</h1>
As of the 2022 VCT tour, the VCT format consists of three tiers: Challengers, Masters, and Champions. Challengers and Masters are split across two stages, known as Stage 1 and Stage 2. The tour starts with the Stage 1 Challengers, regional events in which teams qualify for through open qualifiers. The top teams from each region then move on to the Stage 1 Masters, where teams are no longer split by region. Following the Masters, the top performing teams from Stage 1, as well as teams from another open qualifier, advance to their region's Stage 2 Challengers. Like Stage 1, the top teams from Challengers advance to the Stage 2 Masters.

Performance in Challengers and Masters events earn teams circuit points for advance to Champions, the world championship event of Valorant's esports. The 10 teams qualify through circuit points, and the final 6 teams qualify through a "Last Chance Qualifier" event.

Riot Games has announced a new format starting in 2023 which uses a new Challengers format which will be split into 3 regions - Americas, EMEA and Pacific instead of the 7 regions format (NA, EMEA, SEA, Korea, Japan, Brazil, and LATAM) used in VCT 2021 and VCT 2022. The new format has teams competing in their region's Challengers event to qualify for Challengers Ascension. Every region's Challengers event will have three winners which earns them a two-year promotion into their respective territories’ international league. The promoted teams will qualify for the global events, as well as getting benefits provided by Riot Games. Each year, through the Challengers promotion system, the three international leagues will expand by one team each year until they reach a cap of 14 teams per region in 2027 (42 teams in total).
