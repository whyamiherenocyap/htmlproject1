Swedish man Breach is a tech user who loves to get paid. He was the thirteenth Agent to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL.
Breach is a congenital amputee with artificial arms built by himself, with Raze implementing some major upgrades and custom work. Breach has implied his previous life was as a mercenary. His agent card and voice lines indicate that he is an experienced criminal who has various tricks up his sleeve. Breach's agent card Big Payday shows that he broke into a vault containing an unknown green substance.

Breach's arms are weaponized with many different abilities such as Aftershock which creates an explosion that penetrates walls and severely damages enemies, Flashpoint, a penetrating flash which blinds enemies and Fault Line which initiates a seismic blast, replicating an earthquake and concusses enemies. Similar to Fault Line Breach has the ability to serve up some Rolling Thunder that throws enemies into the air as well as concuss enemies in a larger radius.

Breach despises Kingdom and openly opposes the corporation. No known reason is confirmed. A retconned beta playercard shows Breach with a dog, likely a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, leading many to theorise that he has a pet.
