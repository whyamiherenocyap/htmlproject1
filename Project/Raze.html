Raze, the Brazilian tech user with a positive personality, loves boosting her teammates' moral. Raze is the twelfth to join the Protocol, exploding out of her home city, Salvador.
Raze has a personality reflecting her explosive and colourful playstyle, bringing happiness and positivity to the team. She often cracks bad jokes and lifts the teams spirit, all while obliterating the enemy with her kit. The rest of the team can find Raze annoying, however the way she lightens the atmosphere does not go unnoticed. Raze also loves to party and is always incorporating music and festival at any chance she can get.

All while lifting her team's spirits, Raze deals heavy damage with her dangerous self-made kit. She uses her Paint Shells to send scatter grenades, flushing out and potentially eliminating enemies. Raze also uses Blast Pack to fly through the air, or set as a trap, and her signature Showstopper rocket launcher deals heavy damage, potentially killing enemies instantly. Raze's Boom Bot, also referred to as 'Bomb Buddy', is a cute homing device which explodes when near enemies. Raze creates all her gear, however borrows inspiration, and parts, from her friendly rival Killjoy.

Raze has a negative view towards Kingdom, evident due to the fact that she refers to the results of their practices as an infestation. She believes that they drive people out of their homes and take over diverse and cultured places.
