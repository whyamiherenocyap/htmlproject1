Neon is one of the youngest of the VALORANT PROTOCOL, having an extensive backstory with figures such as Kingdom and Chamber and joining the Protocol for a variety of reasons.

Neon is an ex Kingdom K-SEC worker, who encountered Chamber at one point in her life, and left with a negative outlook towards him. Later, Chamber sought out Neon to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL and she was recruited by Brimstone despite her and Chamber's sour history. It is evident that she is still in contact with her parents, however they do not know what the VALORANT PROTOCOL really is.

Once she is accepted into the Protocol, Sage and Reyna argue over who should train her, with Sage trying to mould her into a noble, proficient fighter while Reyna tries to unlock Neon's full potential by trying to remove the Surge Protector on her back, describing it as a 'muzzle'. Chamber also supports Reyna, trying to get approval from Brimstone to remove her voltage caps, which Neon opposes. Neon is also helping in providing ample power to the Alpha-Omega Bridge built by Killjoy.

Canonicity Unknown
This information was revealed by an article on PhilSTAR L!fe[1] claiming to have interviewed Neon's voice actor, Vanille Velasquez. This information was later removed from the article, and it is not known whether it is retconned or not.

Neon and her bioelectric powers were discovered 20 years ago after a rift appeared in the sky due to a lightning strike near Mount Pulag. A Filipino scientist who had been researching the scene stumbled upon her and adopted her. Neon was raised by the scientist along with a tough Manila Anti-Corruption Task Force officer as her mother. Neon was trained to eventually join this task force along with her mother. Later in life, Neon started working for Kingdom's K-SEC sector, and had a negative run in with Chamber, who she now has a distaste for. It has been revealed that Neon's powers are influenced by her emotions, and that she is a big name in the pro gaming world.

After Neon's AGENT dossier was released with Patch 4.05, it has been confirmed that her father is a scientist and mother is a justice officer.
