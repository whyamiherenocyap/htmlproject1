Omen is the first Radiant to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL, and has a mysterious and dark past that is intertwined with Viper's. The central focus of Omen's character is an unknown event or accident that occurred in his past, resulting in him being 'ripped apart', and transformed from a human into his current state.

The theme of critical elements of Omen's backstory and lore being 'unknown' is a recurring one, with several key plot points and events simply being missing or unclear, never fully described or explained. This seems to have been the general and intentional theme around Omen, with him being the 'mysterious and edgy' character, who's own amnesia mirrors our lack of knowledge about him.

Omen has a cynical and cheerless personally, complimented with a dark sense of humor and a grim attitude. Omen has lost most, if not all, of his memories of his past self prior to the accident, and one of his main goals as a character is to recover them[2]. Relating to this, Omen has intriguing voicelines with Cypher and Viper, both Agents who seem to have some knowledge about Omen's past[3].

Everything that occurred before his accident is highly speculative. However, the community has been able to piece together some key points from various scattered hints and voicelines. Omen has had history with Sage and Viper, and Viper specifically seems to know some details of his past (how much of this she has shared with Omen remains unclear). We also know from Fade's dossier (see below) that Omen worked under several aliases, including Fred, John, Marcus, Yohan and Dimitri.

Omen's overarching goal is to somehow regain his memories of his past self, to find an 'answer' to his current predicament, and return to a 'normal' state. Omen seems to have a notion that he can achieve this from killing, which extends to an eagerness to strike down the enemy team, with comments such as "I feel like myself... catch them, again!" or "Again... hurt them again!" being common.

Omen seems to derive a particular satisfaction from killing his own Omega counterpart, claiming that by killing him and 'taking his memories', he will be able to remember again. Even other Agents like Viper, who is speculated to have some knowledge about Omen's condition, comment that the enemy Omen may be aware of truths kept hidden from their own.
