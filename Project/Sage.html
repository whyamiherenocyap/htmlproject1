Originating from the Shaanxi province in China, Sage is a Radiant healer whose capacity to turn the tide of battle is immeasurable. She is the seventh Agent to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL.

Sage has a kind and compassionate personality, being referred to by some as almost 'mother-like'. While still pretty young, Sage exudes an inner wisdom of someone much older and more mature[1]. She genuinely cares about the wellbeing of her allies, and places great emphasis on collaboration and combined victories.

As suggested by the DIE FOR YOU Music Video, Sage's primary character flaw stems from this caring nature: Sage feels a compulsion to spread her healing to everyone she can; she considers it her duty to solve all the problems and ailments of those she holds close. This insistence on protecting her team forms a 'fatal flaw' of sorts. One of the best in-game representations of this is her voiceline interaction with Viper.

Sage is a Geomancer[2], someone with the power to manipulate the Earth. She channels her abilities through a set of crystalline Radianite orbs[3], which she carries on her belt. Using these, Sage is able to create physical structures in the world. Part of Sage's kit also involves orbs made of pure radianite crystals that, while not an aspect of her power, are rather tools she's made for herself to make use of.

Due to the colour and texture of these 'structures'. such as the wall she summons with her Barrier Orb, a common assumption is that they are made of Ice, which has become a popular and widely-shared fan theory, despite it being known to be false[2]. Another focal point of Sage's ability set are her healing powers, which she refers to in various voicelines as her 'gift' to give out.

After joining the VALORANT PROTOCOL, Sage quickly rose up the ranks. Currently, she is the second-in-command at the Protocol (after Brimstone), and is responsible for various important roles. One of these is implied to be the leader of the Protocol's Radiant Training Program. The Training Program was first hinted at through an email in Brimstone's Office[4], in which Sage discusses the necessity of formalized Radiant training in preparation for recruiting Neon. Judging from the fact that she was the one who introduced Neon into the protocol (as seen in her trailer, Spark), it is assumed that she did get selected for the job.

It has been believed that Sage's miraculous healing comes with (mostly) no strings attached; Sage herself tries her level best to give out her gift to whomever she can. However, it is hinted at that this is not the case: in multiple ominous lines from Omen, he states that her healing is 'upsetting the balance', that her powers of reanimation are so grossly against the natural order of the world that they must immediately put an end to.

This was again hinted at by Fade, who once again raises questions about the costs of her healing. While it is never clearly confirmed, the dossier does emphasize on how Sage's 'toll' keeps rising evermore as she uses her powers, - implying that Sage's powers come with dire (but, so far, undiscovered) consequences[5].

It is heavily implied (through her Contract Tier 9 Playercard, Journey of Trials (see Cards below), and through her dossier) that Sage studied for a while at a Monastery somewhere in China. There, she is implied to have learnt many of her skills, potentially including mastery of her powers. The teachings of this monastery could perhaps tie into her gentle nature and great wisdom, which even Riot's Narrative Lead, Riot ParmCheesy , notes to be 'well beyond her years'[1].

At the moment, her opinions on Kingdom remain unclear, and she does not have any apparent connections with the corporation.
