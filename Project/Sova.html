Sova, the sixth member of the VALORANT PROTOCOL, is a Tech User hailing from the cold tundra of Russia.

Sova has a very calm and level-headed personality. Although he is incredibly dedicated and ruthless towards the enemies, he is warm towards his teammates, always encouraging and complimenting them. He believes in himself and he believes in his team to win. His steadiness and tirelessness on the field is most likely an asset to the morale of the team. He is here to protect his Earth; one can only assume that his experience with the rifts drives this desire.


Sova's abilities are most likely linked to his prosthetic eye, granting him the sight of a hunter. All of his abilities are based on radianite-enhanced technology. Sova also has an Owl Drone, connected to his eye, which he can send to scout ahead and reveal enemies in its Line of Sight. His primary weapon is a collapsible bow, that can be fit with various arrows. In-game, he uses multiple kinds: a Recon Bolt, which attaches itself to a surface and reveals any enemies in its line of sight, and Shock Darts that do damage on contact. When he utilizes Hunter's Fury, he equips his bow with a different kind of arrows that seem to be made from pure energy. These arrows can penetrate through walls, to do heavy damage and reveal struck targets.

Not too much is known of his background before joining the Protocol, although he has survived a great deal. It is implied from the Through the Looking Glass card (see below) that he had had some sort of encounter with a rift in his home country[1], and he has also met his Omega Counterpart in the past. It is implied that he has a military background. Brimstone comments that he has "already lost an eye" for them, an event that may have happened on one of these encounters.
