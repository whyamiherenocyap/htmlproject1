VKAY/O is a cybernetic from an alternate timeline several centuries in the future in which radiants and humans have gone to war. He was designed to kill Radiants[1] using ability-suppressing polarized Radianite[2]. The advanced AI is the 17th agent to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL. KAY/O has a definitive personality, even expressing sarcasm and humor in some voicelines. The robot enjoys 80's Synthwave music[3], and has mastered billiards[4].

KAY/O utilizes polarized Radianite to suppress his enemies in combat, disallowing the use of the opponents' abilities. Using ZERO/POINT, KAY/O is able to throw a knife which sticks in its target and suppresses those nearby. Additionally, KAY/O can utilize FLASH/DRIVE and FRAG/MENT, both grenade-like projectiles stored in his arms, as a Flash and a Molly respectively. Lastly, his ultimate ability, NULL/CMD, overloads his core with polarized radianite energy, causing him to emit large pulses of suppression.

The State of the Agents article preceding KAY/O hinted at his abilities, calling some of them 'familiar to those who've played traditional FPS games their whole lives'. This is in reference to his FLASH/DRIVE and FRAG/MENT, both of which function similar to Flashbangs and Frag Grenades, which are popularly used in other tac-shooters (such as CS:GO).

KAY/O's name is an acronym for 'Kingdom Anti Yield Operative', revealed in his dossier released by Fade. According to Fade, the Kingdom Anti Yield Operative project was meant to be cancelled as it was a rejected proposal, however, KAY/O was still built in spite of this rejection. A colloquial meaning of KAY/O, as coined by the robot in one of his voicelines, is 'Kill All Your Opponents'.

KAY/O is an anti-radiant killing machine built during the Radiant War, which takes place more than 200 years from present day. In it, a brutal war took place between Radiants and Humans, which is implied to have been started and led by Reyna. The specifics of it remain unknown, but it caused a massive split in the VP, causing many to speculate that it took place soon after a ruinous, traumatic event that destabilized the Protocol and its members.

The destruction the RW caused was near-limitless; it is speculated to have killed off several members of the VALORANT PROTOCOL (such as Brimstone and Jett). KAY/O himself is implied to have killed several of those on the radiant side, including Astra, Skye, and Reyna. Traumatized by the horrible toll the war took on the planet, KAY/O decided to travel back in time (so 'current' time) in order to stop the war from taking place. He was possibly helped in this by Thurston Wolf. KAY/O finally arrived at current time though the teleportal at Breeze.
