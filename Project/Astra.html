Coming from Accra, Ghana[1], West-African agent Astra is a powerhouse of control. Astra is the 16th agent to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL and she is a Radiant with ties to the cosmos.
Astra shows her care for her fellow agents through her jokes and serious concern while still focusing on the battle field. Astra's personality is bubbly and humorous, while still being unique to herself. Her attitude sometimes wanders towards mildly obsessive control bordering on perfectionism. According to a tweet from @valorantde, this perfectionism is her primary character flaw.

Astra's abilities work in a very different manner from all the other agents. Unlike them, to use her abilities, Astra must first move into a 'higher plane' with her Astral Form. From there on, she can place down her stars. Her abilities can only be used upon these stars. Her Nebula cloud provides coverage with style while her Nova Pulse and Gravity Well gives the enemy a concussion and keeps them there. The Cosmic Divide is a giant wall panning across the entire map which blocks sound and absorbs damage.

Astra's left arm is encased in gold, which has been inlaid in multiple separate pieces, each of which can float and move on its own. Contrary to some theories, her arm is NOT the source of her power[2] (that comes from her natural Radiance). Her arm merely exists to help her contain and properly use her powers[3].

Astra is a member of a previously unknown group known as the 'Astral Guardians'. Not much is known about them, but it is speculated that they exist to help keep order among the cosmos. It is also speculated that her golden arm is Astral Guardian tech, developed by them for their own purposes.

Astra alludes to knowing the VALORANT PROTOCOL is the morally correct side to fight on. Astra often calls Agents by their country of origin, such as calling Cypher 'Morocco', or Phoenix 'Babylon' (slang for England).
