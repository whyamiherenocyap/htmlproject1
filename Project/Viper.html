Viper is a brilliant scientist coming from the United States. She is the second member of the VALORANT PROTOCOL, joining along with Brimstone[1], and is the second-in-command of the PROTOCOL[2].

While once a brilliant scientist, she no longer thinks clearly, having become hateful and biased in her tests. Her personality reflects this through the passive-aggressiveness present in all her interactions and the resentment she feels towards others. Almost every Agent, at some point or the other, comments on her hate-driven mind. Despite this she is able to express appreciation, being willing to congratulate those who have impressed her.

Viper's abilities are based on self-made concoctions, comprising of toxicants which cause rapid respiratory damage when inhaled. These chemicals, which she manufactures herself, can be released into the air through specialized emitters to create small 'clouds' of the toxic gas. The smoke will eventually dissipate in air if left for long enough, and so the emitter must constantly remain active to retain the smoke's integrity.

When referring to her abilities, Viper refers to the poisonous chemicals as 'Toxins'. This would technically be a misnomer, as the term 'Toxin' refers to harmful biological compounds that can be found in nature, and are produced by living organisms. For artificially manufactured products with similar properties, the term 'Toxicant' is to be used.

Along with Brimstone and Sage, Viper was originally responsible for recruiting new agents[3]. An example of this is given in Viper's voiceline commending Breach, saying that she knew "hiring him was a good idea", implying her involvement in his recruitment.
