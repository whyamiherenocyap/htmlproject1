A UK radiant of fire whose pride comes with ease, Phoenix throws himself into the fray turning the battlefield into his personal playground. Although the ninth to join the protocol, his confidence would make one believe otherwise.

Phoenix's abilities are centered around fire. Being able to set himself on fire at will, Phoenix is also able to manipulate his flames to a degree to form 'constructs' which can affect the environment, such as walls or barriers of flame. It is unclear whether his 'flames' are actually fire (which would imply burning, and in turn, something that is being consumed as a fuel), or just a representation of incredible heat.

Phoenix's powers and abilities mirror his personality, being a happy-go-lucky and cheerful person, brimming with confidence and cockiness. This often results in him making risky, rash, and reckless decisions, which have on multiple times caused a mission to go haywire (for example, one may consider the DUELISTS and DUALITY cinematics).

Phoenix was a theater kid who grew up in South London, specifically in or around the district of Peckham. Later, he attended a Performing Arts school in Peckham as well[1], which he is implied to have burned to the ground at some point (whether this was intentional or not remains unclear).

The Firestarter card is also thought to show this event. Earlier, VALORANT's Creative Director, David Nottingham (aka Riot KingKut) hinted that Phoenix "probably burned down the science lab in school", but it is unclear if this is the canon reason behind the event.
