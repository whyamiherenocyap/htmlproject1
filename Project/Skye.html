	<font size="4"><h1>Lore</h1>
Skye is a Radiant from Eastern Australia, defender of her homeland's flora and fauna. She is in her twenties and used to be a farmer, and some of her hobbies include working out in the gym, morning runs and wood working. She is from the town of Nimbin[1][2]. Her calm and caring personality is complemented by the fact that she knows what it is to lose someone important.

She uses her Radiant powers to animate wooden figures which she calls her pack. The pack is her company, as she usually works alone. It consists of the wooden trinkets or totems as referred to in the game files: a hawk (more specifically, a brown goshawk), a Tasmanian tiger, and three creatures similar to jellyfishes. She also has a totem for her healing ability in the shape of four plants. Skye has tried to create more complex animated animals, such as a dragon, which didn't turn out well.

Skye has a strong connection with plants and animals demonstrated through her trinkets and the drawings on her suit. This has earned her the title of eco-warrior and shaped her antagonistic view towards the Kingdom Corporation and their invasion of natural spaces.

Skye joined the VALORANT PROTOCOL after Sage invites her in. A Rift had appeared in the forest outside an unknown Kingdom facility in Australia. Skye told Sage that she plans to stay and protect her land, but after she realizes that many more such Rifts all opening up all over the world, she accepted Sage's offer to become part of the VALORANT PROTOCOL[3]. All this happens after the events of the DUALITY Cinematic[4] (for more on the events that lead up to her recruitment, see Skye's agent trailer).

Skye's powers comprise weaving life into things through the power of her will, not through any special trait in her totems. The totems are simply inanimate wood carvings, which she uses to better focus her power[5]. It is implied that Skye has not reached her full potential yet. Several agents, such as Omen and KAY/O, comment on this.
