Coming from the USA, Brimstone is a tech user and veteran soldier that has seen all kinds of battles, never leaving a wounded companion behind. He was the first to join the VALORANT PROTOCOL alongside Viper[1][2], and is currently its leader.

Brimstone has a very stubborn personality, acting as a 'father figure' for the group. Named the 'Old Dog' due to his age, he is treated as a leader and titled "Commander" and "Captain" by the other agents. He is in charge, in some part, of picking and hiring new agents to VP[3]. Unlike Viper, Brimstone has a positive attitude regarding the youth in the team, and hiring new members.

Alongside a bottle of scotch and an incendiary grenade, Brimstone uses technology to dominate the battlefield. He has access to an array of satellite-based abilities that allow him to deploy large smoke clouds and launch orbital laser attacks through a bracer on his left arm. Both the bracer and the grenade launcher were designed by Killjoy.

Brimstone's status as the eldest member of the Protocol makes him common target for jokes on his age, but most of them are turned down because of his sheer skill. He also seems to face considerable difficulty with handling technology and devices, oftentimes getting locked out of his bracer simply because he forgot the password.

Interestingly, because his age is likely around 45-50, and the year in which the game takes place in is around 2050, Brimstone is likely a millennial or younger, born at the latest in the late 90s. This would mean that he probably grew up with devices and the internet, which generates some confusion as to the cause of his difficulty with technology.
