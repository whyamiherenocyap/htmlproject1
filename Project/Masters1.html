<h1>Game</h1>
With their win, Sentinels have placed North America at the top of the Valorant esports scene.

The boys from NA did not lose a single map in the tournament, and went 9-0 at Reykjavík. This feat has proven once and for all that they are truly the best team in the world.

Sentinels rose to the occasion
Fans were excited to witness the culmination of the North America versus Europe rivalry, and both teams did not disappoint. It was a showcase of both technical team play and insane individual skills from all the representatives.

This was also the first time Sentinels were truly tested by an opponent. Even though Fnatic lost, they were able to keep all the matches extremely close.

The first two games on Split and Bind went down to the wire, where Sentinels clutched out critical rounds in overtime.
Almost all the rounds towards the end of each game were absolute nail-biters, with the North American representatives barely edging out their European rivals.

Lower Bracket kings Fnatic showed great resilience and a better understanding in their rematch against Sentinels, but ultimately, weren’t able to get the upper hand during overtime.</p></div>

<h1>Finals MVP</h1>

<br>While Sentinels’ win showed they’re currently the best Valorant team, their stand-in player, Tyson “TenZ” Ngo, pulled off an incredible performance that earned him Grand Final MVP honors.

To put some perspective on TenZ’ VCT Stage 2 Masters performance, he had the best stats in the tournament, according to vlr.gg:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<dl>
<dt>289.4 (Average Combat Score/ACS)</dt>
<dt>1.48 (Highest kill-to-death ratio)</dt>
<dt>1.02 (Most kills-per-round)</dt>
<dt>0.20 (Most first kills)</dt>
<dt>0.09 (Least first deaths)</dt>
</dl>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
After winning the tournament, TenZ expressed his hope to continue playing with Sentinels, despite still being under contract with Cloud9.
