Killjoy is the 4th agent to join the Protocol. She is a young tech user and a genius, who uses various gadgets and bots of her own invention in combat. She is of German origin, (however, only one of her parents being of German ancestry[1]).

The focal point of Killjoy's personality is her incredible mind. She is without doubt the smartest Agent in the Protocol, a fact that she is very well aware of. This manifests itself in a strong confidence in herself and her intelligence, not without a fair share of bragging. She is proud and willful, with a high feeling of self-importance.

She uses her various inventions both inside and outside combat to her advantage. All of her abilities are various pieces of highly advanced technology, that she uses on the battlefield to give her an edge. Killjoy controls all her abilities with with a holographic bracelet on her left arm, with which she is able to summon or pull back any of her bots.

Her primary bots are a Sentry Turret, which can stand in place[2] and fire damaging salvos at the enemy. Her other abilities are a pair of Nanoswarm Grenades that fit into the pockets of her Backpack, which can be activated from a distance to damage all enemies in the Radius. Her Alarmbot is a covert bot that can detect enemies that get too close. Her Ultimate is a special device that applies the Detained effect to all enemies in a large radius.

Killjoy's breathtaking genius earned her a lot of awards and esteem, even becoming the lead of Kingdom's Research and Development division at the age of 18. She was a very successful inventor during this period of her life, however, she was (and still is, to a certain extent) also characterized by a rash irresponsibility for any of the consequences of her creations.

While it is implied that most of these consequences are a result of misuse by Kingdom, and they were not Killjoy's intentions when she made her inventions, Killjoy's utter inability to ensure the proper usage of her creations is still the core of the issue. She stills holds some responsibility for all the harm done.

One of the more well-known representations of this is her infamous relationship with Reyna (see Relationships below for more details). Reyna has a terrible dislike for Killjoy, which is hinted to be because one of Killjoy's old inventions was used to harm someone close to her (assumedly Reyna's younger sister, Lucia). Killjoy herself did not, of course, intend for her creations to be used to harm others like this - indeed, it seems that she has no idea that her creations were used in this manner at all - but the harm has been done to Lucia all the same.

However, despite her faults, Killjoy is still definitely a caring and sensitive person at heart. We see this most clearly in how the mourns the deaths of the scientists in the Everett-Linde facility (Fracture, before the disaster that took place there) in a Voicemail to Brimstone, bemoaning the loss of valuable research and scientific expertise in the explosion - note that, at this point, the Protocol is still unaware that Chamber was responsible for the Everett-Linde Incident.
